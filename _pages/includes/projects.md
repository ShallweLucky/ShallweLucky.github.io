## Genetic Algorithm Optimization for Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) 

- Goal: To design and implement an improved genetic algorithm that outperforms a given baseline algorithm in solving the mTSP, focusing on reducing tour costs and avoiding local optima in high-dimensional instances.

- Actions & Achievements
    - Developed an improved genetic algorithm with: Hybrid KMeans-based initialization,  Novel Two-Part Chromosome Crossover (TCX) inspired operator, Intra-chromosome mutation and Optimized distance calculations.
    - Quantified the improvements (e.g., 15-30% reduction in costs, 20% improvement in efficiency) and highlighted validation methods (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm based on 6 TSPLIB instances (51-226 cities).
